# Exercise Library: Your Complete Movement Guide

## Introduction to Your Exercise Library

This comprehensive exercise library contains every movement you'll need throughout your 12-week glute activation and recovery programme. Each exercise has been carefully selected based on scientific research and clinical experience to address your specific dysfunction patterns and progressively restore your glute function.

The exercises are organised by phase and equipment requirements, with detailed instructions, coaching cues, common mistakes, and progression guidelines for each movement. Visual demonstrations accompany each exercise to ensure perfect form and maximum effectiveness.

### How to Use This Library

**Exercise Selection**: Follow your phase-specific programme for exercise selection. Don't jump ahead to advanced exercises until you've mastered the fundamentals.

**Form First**: Perfect form is always more important than repetitions, weight, or speed. Master the movement pattern before progressing.

**Listen to Your Body**: All exercises should be performed pain-free. If you experience pain, reduce the range of motion, decrease intensity, or contact Coach Pete for modifications.

**Progressive Overload**: Once you can perform an exercise with perfect form for the prescribed repetitions, you're ready to progress using the guidelines provided.

## Phase 1 Exercises: Activation & Stability (Weeks 1-4)

### Foundation Exercises

#### Glute Bridge (Supine)
**Primary Target**: Gluteus maximus activation and hip extension pattern
**Equipment**: None (mat optional)
**Phase**: 1 (Weeks 1-4)

**Starting Position**: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Arms should be by your sides for stability. Your feet should be positioned so that when you lift your hips, your shins are vertical.

**Execution**: 
1. Begin by gently engaging your core muscles, pressing your lower back toward the floor
2. Squeeze your glutes and drive through your heels to lift your hips off the ground
3. Raise your hips until your body forms a straight line from your knees to your shoulders
4. Hold this position for 2-3 seconds, focusing on feeling the contraction in your glutes
5. Slowly lower your hips back to the starting position with control

**Breathing**: Exhale as you lift your hips, inhale as you lower them down.

**Sets and Repetitions**: 
- Week 1-2: 2 sets of 8-10 repetitions, 2-second holds
- Week 3-4: 2-3 sets of 12-15 repetitions, 3-5 second holds

**Coaching Cues**:
- "Squeeze your glutes like you're trying to crack a walnut between your cheeks"
- "Drive through your heels, not your toes"
- "Keep your ribs down and core engaged throughout"
- "Think about pushing the floor away with your feet"
- "Maintain a neutral spine – don't arch your back excessively"

**Common Mistakes**:
- Using hamstrings instead of glutes (feel for this by placing hands on glutes)
- Arching the back excessively at the top position
- Pushing through toes instead of heels
- Rushing the movement without focusing on glute activation
- Allowing knees to fall inward or outward

**Progressions**:
1. Increase hold time (up to 10 seconds)
2. Add resistance band around thighs
3. Single-leg variation (assisted)
4. Feet elevated on step or couch
5. Add external weight across hips

**Regression Options**:
- Reduce range of motion (partial bridges)
- Place pillow between knees for better glute activation
- Perform with feet on wall for support
- Focus on glute squeezes without lifting hips

**Why This Exercise**: The glute bridge is the foundation of your programme because it allows you to learn glute activation in a supported position without the challenge of gravity or balance. Research shows it's one of the most effective exercises for teaching proper glute firing patterns.

#### Clamshells
**Primary Target**: Gluteus medius activation and hip stability
**Equipment**: None (resistance band optional)
**Phase**: 1 (Weeks 1-4)

**Starting Position**: Lie on your side with your hips and knees bent to approximately 90 degrees. Your feet should be together, and your head can rest on your bottom arm or a pillow for comfort. Ensure your body is in a straight line from head to hips.

**Execution**:
1. Keep your feet together throughout the movement
2. Slowly lift your top knee while maintaining contact between your feet
3. Lift only as high as you can while keeping your pelvis stable
4. Hold the top position for 1-2 seconds, feeling the contraction on the side of your hip
5. Slowly lower your knee back to the starting position with control

**Breathing**: Exhale as you lift your knee, inhale as you lower it.

**Sets and Repetitions**:
- Week 1-2: 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions each side
- Week 3-4: 2-3 sets of 15-20 repetitions each side

**Coaching Cues**:
- "Lead with your knee, not your foot"
- "Keep your pelvis stable – don't let it roll backward"
- "Feel the work on the side of your hip, not in your hip flexors"
- "Maintain the 90-degree angle in your hips and knees"
- "Move slowly and with control"

**Common Mistakes**:
- Rolling the pelvis backward during the movement
- Using hip flexors instead of gluteus medius
- Moving too quickly without control
- Lifting the knee too high and losing form
- Allowing the feet to separate

**Progressions**:
1. Add resistance band around thighs
2. Increase hold time at top position
3. Perform with straight legs (side-lying hip abduction)
4. Add ankle weights
5. Perform in standing position against wall

**Regression Options**:
- Reduce range of motion
- Perform without any hold at the top
- Use pillow between knees for support
- Perform in sitting position

**Why This Exercise**: Clamshells specifically target your gluteus medius, which is crucial for hip stability and preventing knee valgus. This muscle often becomes weak alongside the gluteus maximus and needs specific attention to restore proper function.

#### Dead Bug (Modified)
**Primary Target**: Core stability and glute-core coordination
**Equipment**: None (mat optional)
**Phase**: 1 (Weeks 1-4)

**Starting Position**: Lie on your back with your arms reaching straight up toward the ceiling and your knees bent to 90 degrees, with your thighs vertical and shins parallel to the floor. Press your lower back gently into the floor.

**Execution**:
1. Maintain contact between your lower back and the floor throughout the movement
2. Slowly lower one arm overhead while simultaneously extending the opposite leg
3. Lower only as far as you can while maintaining back contact with the floor
4. Hold the end position for 2-3 seconds
5. Return to the starting position with control
6. Repeat with the opposite arm and leg

**Breathing**: Exhale during the movement, inhale as you return to start.

**Sets and Repetitions**:
- Week 1-2: 2 sets of 5-6 repetitions each side
- Week 3-4: 2-3 sets of 8-10 repetitions each side

**Coaching Cues**:
- "Keep your lower back pressed into the floor"
- "Move slowly and with control"
- "Breathe normally throughout the movement"
- "Only move as far as you can while maintaining back contact"
- "Think about reaching long with your arm and leg"

**Common Mistakes**:
- Allowing the lower back to arch off the floor
- Moving too quickly without control
- Extending the leg too far and losing core stability
- Holding breath during the movement
- Using momentum instead of control

**Progressions**:
1. Increase range of motion gradually
2. Add light weights to hands
3. Perform with resistance band around feet
4. Hold end position for longer
5. Perform on unstable surface

**Regression Options**:
- Move only the arm or only the leg (not both)
- Reduce range of motion significantly
- Place hands on core to feel engagement
- Perform with knees supported

**Why This Exercise**: The dead bug teaches your core and glutes to work together, which is essential for proper movement patterns. It also helps establish the core stability needed for more advanced exercises later in the programme.

### Mobility and Stretching Exercises

#### Hip Flexor Stretch (Couch Stretch Modified)
**Primary Target**: Hip flexor length and glute activation
**Equipment**: Couch, chair, or wall
**Phase**: 1 (Weeks 1-4)

**Starting Position**: Kneel in front of a couch or chair with one foot flat on the floor in a lunge position. Place the top of your back foot on the couch behind you. Your front thigh should be parallel to the floor or slightly higher.

**Execution**:
1. Keep your torso upright and engage your core
2. Gently push your hips forward while maintaining an upright posture
3. You should feel a stretch in the front of your hip of the back leg
4. Hold this position while breathing deeply
5. To increase the stretch, gently squeeze the glute of the back leg

**Breathing**: Deep, relaxed breathing throughout the hold.

**Sets and Repetitions**:
- 30-45 seconds each side, 2-3 times per day
- Can be performed multiple times throughout the day

**Coaching Cues**:
- "Keep your torso upright – don't lean forward"
- "Push your hips forward, not your torso"
- "Breathe deeply and relax into the stretch"
- "Squeeze your back glute to increase the stretch"
- "Feel the stretch in the front of your hip, not your back"

**Common Mistakes**:
- Leaning forward instead of pushing hips forward
- Arching the back excessively
- Holding breath during the stretch
- Forcing the stretch too aggressively
- Not maintaining proper front leg position

**Progressions**:
1. Add gentle pulsing movements
2. Incorporate arm movements overhead
3. Add rotation to target different hip flexor fibres
4. Increase hold time gradually
5. Perform with back foot higher

**Regression Options**:
- Perform standing hip flexor stretch against wall
- Reduce the depth of the lunge position
- Use pillows for knee support
- Perform seated hip flexor stretch

**Why This Exercise**: Tight hip flexors are a primary cause of glute inhibition. By improving hip flexor length, we allow your glutes to function in their optimal length-tension relationship and reduce reciprocal inhibition.

## Phase 2 Exercises: Strength Without Strain (Weeks 5-8)

### Progressive Strengthening Exercises

#### Resistance Band Glute Bridge
**Primary Target**: Gluteus maximus and medius strengthening
**Equipment**: Resistance band (light to medium)
**Phase**: 2 (Weeks 5-8)

**Starting Position**: Same as regular glute bridge, but with a resistance band placed around your thighs just above your knees. The band should have light to moderate tension when your knees are hip-width apart.

**Execution**:
1. Begin in the glute bridge starting position with the band in place
2. As you lift your hips, actively push your knees apart against the band resistance
3. Maintain outward pressure on the band throughout the entire movement
4. Hold the top position for 3-5 seconds while maintaining band tension
5. Lower with control while continuing to resist the band's inward pull

**Breathing**: Exhale as you lift and push out, inhale as you lower.

**Sets and Repetitions**:
- Week 5-6: 3 sets of 12-15 repetitions, 3-second holds
- Week 7-8: 3-4 sets of 15-20 repetitions, 5-second holds

**Coaching Cues**:
- "Push your knees apart like you're trying to break the band"
- "Maintain band tension throughout the entire movement"
- "Feel the work in your glutes and the sides of your hips"
- "Don't let the band pull your knees together"
- "Drive through your heels while pushing out"

**Common Mistakes**:
- Allowing knees to collapse inward
- Losing band tension during the movement
- Using too heavy a band initially
- Focusing only on the bridge and ignoring the abduction
- Rushing through the movement

**Progressions**:
1. Use heavier resistance band
2. Increase hold time at top
3. Add single-leg variation with band
4. Combine with marching movements
5. Add external weight across hips

**Why This Exercise**: The addition of the resistance band targets both your gluteus maximus and medius simultaneously, while the outward pressure helps counteract knee valgus patterns and reinforces proper movement mechanics.

#### Lateral Band Walks
**Primary Target**: Gluteus medius and hip stability
**Equipment**: Resistance band (light to medium)
**Phase**: 2 (Weeks 5-8)

**Starting Position**: Place a resistance band around your ankles or just above your knees. Stand with feet hip-width apart, creating slight tension in the band. Maintain a quarter-squat position with your chest up and core engaged.

**Execution**:
1. Maintain the quarter-squat position throughout the movement
2. Step sideways with one leg, maintaining tension in the band
3. Follow with the other leg, but don't let your feet come together
4. Continue stepping in one direction for the prescribed number of steps
5. Reverse direction and return to your starting position

**Breathing**: Maintain steady breathing throughout the movement.

**Sets and Repetitions**:
- Week 5-6: 2-3 sets of 10-12 steps each direction
- Week 7-8: 3 sets of 15-20 steps each direction

**Coaching Cues**:
- "Keep your knees pointing forward throughout"
- "Maintain the squat position – don't stand up between steps"
- "Feel the work on the sides of your hips"
- "Keep tension in the band at all times"
- "Take controlled steps, don't rush"

**Common Mistakes**:
- Standing up between steps
- Allowing knees to cave inward
- Taking steps that are too large
- Losing band tension
- Leaning to one side during movement

**Progressions**:
1. Use heavier resistance band
2. Increase number of steps
3. Add squat at each step
4. Perform in deeper squat position
5. Add upper body movements

**Why This Exercise**: Lateral band walks directly challenge your gluteus medius in a functional, weight-bearing position, improving hip stability and addressing the frontal plane weakness common in glute dysfunction.

#### Modified Step-Ups
**Primary Target**: Unilateral glute strength and functional movement
**Equipment**: Step or platform (15-20cm high)
**Phase**: 2 (Weeks 5-8)

**Starting Position**: Stand facing a step with one foot completely on the step. Your entire foot should be in contact with the step, not just your toes. Keep your torso upright and core engaged.

**Execution**:
1. Focus on pushing through the heel of the foot on the step
2. Slowly step up, driving through the elevated leg
3. Avoid pushing off with your ground leg – let the elevated leg do all the work
4. Stand tall on the step for a moment
5. Slowly lower yourself back down with control, focusing on the eccentric portion

**Breathing**: Exhale as you step up, inhale as you step down.

**Sets and Repetitions**:
- Week 5-6: 2 sets of 8-10 repetitions each leg
- Week 7-8: 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions each leg

**Coaching Cues**:
- "Push through your heel, not your toes"
- "Let your elevated leg do all the work"
- "Control the descent – don't just drop down"
- "Keep your torso upright throughout"
- "Feel the work in your glute of the stepping leg"

**Common Mistakes**:
- Pushing off with the ground leg
- Using momentum instead of control
- Leaning forward excessively
- Stepping down too quickly
- Not placing entire foot on step

**Progressions**:
1. Increase step height gradually
2. Add external weight (dumbbells or weighted vest)
3. Increase tempo of movement
4. Add knee drive at top
5. Perform lateral step-ups

**Why This Exercise**: Step-ups are one of the most functional glute exercises, closely mimicking real-life activities like climbing stairs. Research shows they produce very high glute activation while being relatively safe and easy to progress.

## Phase 3 Exercises: Power & Integration (Weeks 9-12)

### Advanced Strengthening and Power Exercises

#### Hip Thrusts (Loaded)
**Primary Target**: Maximum glute activation and power development
**Equipment**: Bench or couch, weight (books, water bottles, or proper weights)
**Phase**: 3 (Weeks 9-12)

**Starting Position**: Sit with your upper back against a bench or couch, knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place a weight across your hips (start light and progress gradually). Your feet should be positioned so your shins are vertical at the top of the movement.

**Execution**:
1. Engage your core and squeeze your glutes
2. Drive through your heels to lift your hips up
3. Raise your hips until your thighs are parallel to the floor
4. Squeeze your glutes hard at the top position for 1-2 seconds
5. Lower your hips with control, maintaining tension in your glutes

**Breathing**: Exhale forcefully as you drive up, inhale as you lower.

**Sets and Repetitions**:
- Week 9-10: 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions
- Week 11-12: 4 sets of 10-15 repetitions

**Coaching Cues**:
- "Drive through your heels with maximum force"
- "Squeeze your glutes as hard as possible at the top"
- "Keep your core tight throughout"
- "Don't hyperextend your back at the top"
- "Control the weight on the way down"

**Common Mistakes**:
- Hyperextending the back instead of using glutes
- Using too much weight too soon
- Not achieving full hip extension
- Rushing through the movement
- Allowing knees to cave inward

**Progressions**:
1. Gradually increase weight
2. Add pause at top position
3. Single-leg variation
4. Add resistance band around knees
5. Increase range of motion with deficit

**Why This Exercise**: Research consistently shows hip thrusts produce the highest glute activation of any exercise. They're the gold standard for glute development and power, making them essential for the final phase of your programme.

#### Bulgarian Split Squats
**Primary Target**: Unilateral glute strength and stability
**Equipment**: Bench, chair, or couch for rear foot elevation
**Phase**: 3 (Weeks 9-12)

**Starting Position**: Stand 2-3 feet in front of a bench with your back to it. Place the top of one foot on the bench behind you. Your front foot should be positioned so that when you lower down, your shin remains vertical.

**Execution**:
1. Lower your body by bending your front knee and hip
2. Focus on sitting back into your front hip rather than dropping straight down
3. Lower until your front thigh is parallel to the floor or as low as comfortable
4. Drive through your front heel to return to the starting position
5. Complete all repetitions on one side before switching

**Breathing**: Inhale as you lower, exhale as you drive up.

**Sets and Repetitions**:
- Week 9-10: 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions each leg
- Week 11-12: 3-4 sets of 12-15 repetitions each leg

**Coaching Cues**:
- "Sit back into your front hip"
- "Keep most of your weight on your front leg"
- "Drive through your front heel to stand up"
- "Keep your torso upright throughout"
- "Feel the work in your front glute"

**Common Mistakes**:
- Putting too much weight on the back leg
- Leaning forward excessively
- Allowing the front knee to cave inward
- Not achieving adequate depth
- Using the back leg to push off

**Progressions**:
1. Add external weight (dumbbells or weighted vest)
2. Increase range of motion
3. Add tempo variations (slow eccentric)
4. Perform on unstable surface
5. Add lateral or rotational components

**Why This Exercise**: Bulgarian split squats challenge each leg independently, addressing any strength imbalances while requiring significant glute activation for both strength and stability. They're excellent preparation for returning to bilateral squatting movements.

### Functional Integration Exercises

#### Single-Leg Romanian Deadlifts (Unassisted)
**Primary Target**: Posterior chain integration and balance
**Equipment**: None (light weight optional)
**Phase**: 3 (Weeks 11-12)

**Starting Position**: Stand on one leg with a slight bend in your knee. Keep your core engaged and shoulders back. Your free leg should be slightly behind you.

**Execution**:
1. Hinge at your hip by pushing your hips back
2. Lower your torso toward the floor while extending your free leg behind you
3. Keep your back straight and reach toward the ground
4. Feel a stretch in your hamstring of the standing leg
5. Drive through your heel and squeeze your glute to return to standing

**Breathing**: Inhale as you hinge down, exhale as you return to standing.

**Sets and Repetitions**:
- Week 11-12: 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions each leg

**Coaching Cues**:
- "Push your hips back, don't just bend forward"
- "Keep your back straight throughout"
- "Feel the stretch in your hamstring"
- "Drive through your heel to stand up"
- "Squeeze your glute at the top"

**Common Mistakes**:
- Rounding the back
- Bending at the waist instead of hinging at the hip
- Losing balance and using momentum
- Not achieving adequate hip hinge
- Forgetting to engage the glute on the way up

**Progressions**:
1. Add light external weight
2. Increase range of motion
3. Add tempo variations
4. Perform on unstable surface
5. Add rotational components

**Why This Exercise**: Single-leg RDLs represent the pinnacle of posterior chain integration, requiring strength, balance, coordination, and proper movement patterns. They're excellent preparation for return to higher-level activities.

## Exercise Troubleshooting Guide

### "I Can't Feel My Glutes Working"

This is one of the most common issues in the early stages of glute rehabilitation. Here are strategies to improve glute activation:

**Pre-Activation Techniques**:
- Perform glute squeezes for 10 seconds before starting exercises
- Use your hands to feel for glute contraction during movements
- Try different foot positions (wider, narrower, toes turned out)
- Perform exercises in front of a mirror to check for compensation

**Form Modifications**:
- Slow down the movement to focus on muscle activation
- Reduce range of motion and focus on the squeeze
- Try different exercise variations until you find one that works
- Use lighter resistance or bodyweight only initially

**Mental Focus Techniques**:
- Visualise your glutes contracting before and during exercises
- Use the mind-muscle connection by concentrating on the target area
- Practice glute activation exercises multiple times throughout the day
- Be patient – neural adaptations take time to develop

### "I Feel It in the Wrong Muscles"

Compensation patterns are common when starting glute rehabilitation. Here's how to address them:

**Hamstring Dominance**:
- Focus on driving through your heels, not your toes
- Ensure your feet aren't positioned too far from your body
- Try placing a small pillow between your knees during bridges
- Reduce range of motion and focus on glute activation

**Lower Back Compensation**:
- Engage your core before starting each exercise
- Avoid excessive arching of your back
- Focus on posterior pelvic tilt during glute bridges
- Reduce the range of motion until form improves

**Quad Dominance (in squatting movements)**:
- Focus on sitting back into your hips rather than bending your knees
- Ensure you're driving through your heels
- Practice the hip hinge pattern without weight first
- Consider using a box or chair to practice proper depth

### "The Exercises Are Too Easy/Hard"

**If Exercises Are Too Easy**:
- Focus on perfect form and maximum muscle activation
- Increase hold times rather than repetitions initially
- Add complexity (single-leg variations, unstable surfaces)
- Progress to the next phase guidelines when ready

**If Exercises Are Too Hard**:
- Reduce range of motion
- Decrease repetitions or sets
- Use regression options provided
- Focus on form over intensity
- Consider working with a qualified professional

### Equipment Modifications

**No Resistance Bands**:
- Use towels or old tights for light resistance
- Focus on bodyweight variations with longer holds
- Emphasise control and activation over resistance
- Progress to weighted variations when possible

**No Weights Available**:
- Use household items (water bottles, books, backpack)
- Focus on single-leg variations for increased difficulty
- Emphasise tempo and control
- Use isometric holds for increased challenge

**Limited Space**:
- Most exercises can be performed in a 6x6 foot area
- Use wall-supported variations when needed
- Focus on floor-based exercises
- Modify step-ups using stairs if available

## Exercise Safety Guidelines

### Pain vs. Discomfort

**Acceptable Sensations**:
- Muscle fatigue and burning in the target muscles
- Mild stretching sensation during mobility exercises
- General muscle soreness 24-48 hours after exercise
- Feeling of muscle activation and engagement

**Unacceptable Sensations (Stop Exercise)**:
- Sharp, shooting, or stabbing pain
- Joint pain in knees, hips, or back
- Numbness or tingling
- Pain that worsens during or after exercise
- Any pain rated above 2/10 on a pain scale

### When to Modify or Stop

**Immediate Modifications Needed**:
- Any increase in your baseline pain levels
- Inability to maintain proper form
- Excessive fatigue that compromises technique
- Dizziness or lightheadedness

**When to Contact Coach Pete**:
- Persistent increase in pain levels
- Inability to progress after 2 weeks
- Questions about exercise modifications
- Concerns about your programme progression

### Recovery and Rest Guidelines

**Between Exercises**:
- Rest 30-60 seconds between sets for activation exercises
- Rest 60-90 seconds between sets for strengthening exercises
- Listen to your body and rest longer if needed

**Between Sessions**:
- Allow at least one day of rest between intense sessions
- Light movement and stretching on rest days is beneficial
- Ensure adequate sleep for recovery (7-9 hours)
- Stay hydrated and maintain proper nutrition

**Signs You Need More Rest**:
- Persistent muscle soreness lasting more than 3 days
- Decreased performance or inability to maintain form
- Increased irritability or fatigue
- Loss of motivation for exercise

This comprehensive exercise library provides you with everything you need to successfully complete your 12-week glute activation and recovery programme. Remember that consistency and proper form are more important than intensity or speed of progression. Trust the process, listen to your body, and don't hesitate to reach out for guidance when needed.
