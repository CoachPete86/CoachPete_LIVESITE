      <h2 class="section-title">What Personal Training Really Means</h2>
      <p class="section-description">
        Forget generic sessions and guesswork. My one-to-one coaching is built around *you* — your body, your lifestyle, your ambition. I design a programme that fits your real life and evolves as you do. I’m not just guiding workouts — I’m coaching the person, not the plan.
      </p>
      <p class="section-description">
        Whether you're starting out or rebuilding after injury, chasing performance or trying to find your fire again — we train for outcomes. You’ll be coached, challenged, and kept on track with full accountability.

      <h2 class="section-title">The Real Benefits</h2>
      <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li><strong>Custom Programming:</strong> No cut-and-paste workouts. Just results-driven plans tailored to your goals, strengths, and areas that need work.</li>
        <li><strong>Expert Feedback:</strong> Every session includes real-time technique correction, form analysis, and mindset coaching.</li>
        <li><strong>Progress Built In:</strong> We don’t train for the sake of it — we train with structure, progression, and purpose built into every block.</li>
        <li><strong>Injury Prevention:</strong> Mobility, joint prep, and exercise selection done smart — not just hard — to keep you training, not recovering.</li>

      <h2 class="section-title">FAQs</h2>
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>Where do sessions take place?</h3>
        <p>Sessions can be at PureGym West Byfleet, outdoors, or I come to you (if local). We'll choose the best environment for your goal and style.</p>
        <h3>How soon will I see results?</h3>
        <p>Expect energy and posture changes in 2–3 weeks, physical changes by 4–6. Real transformation builds across 8–12+ weeks depending on effort.</p>
        <h3>Is this right for complete beginners?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. I specialise in working with beginners, rebuilders and returners. We start where you are, and move forward — no intimidation, no pressure.</p>
