      <p class="section-description">Forget one-size-fits-all. My personal training approach is about building <strong>your</strong> results around <strong>your</strong> life.

      <p class="section-description">You won’t just “turn up and sweat”. You'll learn the right movement for your body, with precision coaching and a plan that adapts with you. You'll be held accountable, challenged, and supported every step of the way.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Still Wondering if This is For You?</h2>
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>Is personal training right for beginners?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. Beginners benefit the most from smart programming and expert form coaching. I'll meet you where you're at — not where you think you 'should' be.</p>

        <h3>Where do sessions take place?</h3>
        <p>Sessions happen at my private studio in Surrey, or outdoors depending on weather and preference. We’ll pick what suits your routine and goals.</p>

        <h3>How quickly will I see results?</h3>
        <p>Most feel changes in week one. You’ll move better, sleep better, and feel more energised. Body changes follow fast when you stay consistent — expect noticeable change in 4–6 weeks and major shifts from week 8+.</p>

        <h3>Do you guarantee results?</h3>
        <p>First session satisfaction is 100% guaranteed. Beyond that, I coach — you execute. If you show up and commit, the results <em>will</em> come.</p>
