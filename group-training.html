      <h2 class="section-title">What is Group Training?</h2>
      <p class="section-description">
        Group training combines expert coaching with community motivation. The atmosphere created when you train alongside others can drive effort, encourage consistency, and transform your workouts from a task into a high-energy, fulfilling experience. My sessions are engineered to challenge and support you — whatever your current level.
      </p>
      <p class="section-description">
        Whether you're joining solo or with friends, you'll never feel lost or overlooked. My groups are deliberately small so that everyone receives proper technique guidance, individualised encouragement, and smart progression. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">FAQs</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can beginners join?</h3>
        <p>Yes — everyone starts somewhere. I scale every exercise to your level. Whether you're new or returning, you’ll be safe and supported.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this like a fitness class?</h3>
        <p>No — this is coaching. Not a workout you're thrown into. I keep numbers small, tailor movements, and build rapport with each member. You're coached, not just cued.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I bring friends?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. Build your own squad and let’s create a time slot for your group. Or join an existing group — it’s all about finding the right fit.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if I miss a session?</h3>
        <p>You’ll have access to the workout via my app, or you can reschedule if space allows. The goal is consistency, but I’ll work with your real life schedule.</p>
