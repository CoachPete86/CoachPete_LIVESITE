### Key Research Sources

#### NCBI Research: "Assessing and Treating Gluteus Maximus Weakness" (Buckthorpe et al., 2019)
**Source**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6670060/

**Key Findings:**

**Gluteus Maximus Function:**
- Largest and most powerful muscle in human body (16% of total cross-sectional area)
- Three basic functions: local stabilizer, global stabilizer, global mobilizer
- Critical for maintaining upright posture and optimal movement patterns

**Local Stabilization Roles:**
- Lower back stabilization via connection with erector spinae and thoraco-lumbar fascia
- Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) bracing and compression
- Lumbo-sacral region stabilization via co-contraction with psoas major
- Femoral head stabilization in acetabulum
- Knee joint stabilization in extension (via iliotibial band attachment)

**Global Stabilization Functions:**
- Prevents trunk forward lean and rotation
- Stabilizes pelvis during single leg stance
- Prevents femoral adduction and internal rotation
- Works with other gluteal muscles to counteract gravity's hip adduction torque

**Global Mobilizer Functions:**
- Produces large amounts of force for hip extension and external rotation
- Superior fibers: hip abduction torque
- Inferior fibers: hip adduction torque

**Dysfunction Consequences:**
- Contributes to chronic pain, injury, and athletic under-performance
- Linked to: anterior knee pain, ACL injuries, low back pain, hamstring strains, femoral acetabular impingement, ankle sprains
- Results in compensation patterns and altered movement mechanics

**Causes of Dysfunction:**
1. **Lifestyle Factors**: Prolonged sitting reduces GM activation, leading to atrophy and weakness
2. **Synergistic Dominance**: Over-reliance on secondary hip extensors (hamstrings, hip adductors)
3. **Postural Issues**: Anterior pelvic tilt elongates GM, placing it in mechanically disadvantaged position
4. **Reciprocal Inhibition**: Hip flexor tightness inhibits GM activation
5. **Pain/Swelling**: Potent inhibitor of muscle function

**Clinical Implications for Cat Parker:**
- Joint pain in knees, hips, feet directly correlates with research findings
- Underactive glutes diagnosis aligns with established dysfunction patterns
- Medical advice to avoid squats/heavy compounds is evidence-based approach
- Recovery requires systematic approach addressing root causes, not just symptoms



#### NCBI Research: "Gluteus Maximus Activation during Common Strength and Hypertrophy Exercises" (Neto et al., 2020)
**Source**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7039033/

**Exercise Classification by Activation Level:**

**Very High Activation (>60% MVIC):**
- Step-up and variations (lateral, diagonal, cross-over)
- Hip thrusts (traditional, American, rotational, band, pull)
- Deadlifts (hex bar, conventional)
- Squats (belt squat, modified single-leg squat)
- Lunges (split squat, in-line lunge, traditional lunge)

**Key Research Findings:**
- Step-up exercises show highest GMax activation due to stabilisation requirements
- External load, movement velocity, fatigue level, and mechanical complexity directly influence activation
- Bilateral exercises can provide very high activation levels when properly executed
- Joint stabilisation requirements increase muscle activation

**Clinical Application for Cat Parker:**
- Progressive exercise selection based on activation levels
- Start with bodyweight variations before adding external load
- Focus on stabilisation and control before increasing intensity
- Step-ups and hip thrusts should be prioritised in later phases

**Compensation Pattern Summary:**
Based on research findings, Cat's underactive glutes create a cascade of dysfunction:

1. **Primary Issue**: Gluteus maximus weakness/inhibition
2. **Immediate Compensation**: Synergistic dominance by hamstrings and hip adductors
3. **Secondary Effects**: 
   - Anterior pelvic tilt (hip flexor tightness)
   - Reduced hip extension range of motion
   - Altered movement patterns
4. **Tertiary Consequences**:
   - Knee valgus (inward collapse)
   - Increased knee joint stress
   - Hip joint dysfunction
   - Foot/ankle compensation patterns
   - Lower back overactivation

**Evidence-Based Recovery Approach:**
- Address root cause (glute activation) rather than symptoms
- Progressive loading based on tissue tolerance
- Avoid aggravating movements until function restored
- Systematic approach addressing all compensation patterns
