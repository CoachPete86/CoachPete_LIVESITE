# Weekly Routine Layouts & Progress Tracking

## How to Use Your Weekly Routines

Your 12-week programme is structured into three distinct phases, each with specific weekly routines designed to progressively restore your glute function. These printable layouts provide you with clear, day-by-day guidance and progress tracking capabilities.

### Layout Features

**Daily Structure**: Each day shows exactly which exercises to perform, with sets, repetitions, and hold times clearly specified.

**Progress Tracking**: Tick boxes and notes sections allow you to track completion and record how each exercise felt.

**Modification Space**: Areas to note any modifications or adjustments made during your session.

**Weekly Reflection**: End-of-week assessment to monitor your overall progress and plan for the following week.

### Tracking Guidelines

**Completion Tracking**: Tick the box when you complete each exercise with proper form.

**Quality Rating**: Rate each exercise on a 1-5 scale:
- 1 = Very difficult, poor form
- 2 = Difficult, some compensation
- 3 = Moderate, good form
- 4 = Easy, excellent form
- 5 = Too easy, ready to progress

**Pain Monitoring**: Note any pain levels (0-10 scale) before and after each session.

**Notes Section**: Record observations about glute activation, energy levels, or any concerns.
