      <h2 class="section-title">What This Is</h2>
      <p class="section-description">
        This programme is not just about fitness or nutrition in isolation. It’s a complete overhaul of your habits, mindset, training, routines, nutrition, and lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p class="section-description">
        Lifestyle Transformation is where we take every part of your current routine — and rebuild it for long-term, sustainable, identity-level change. We remove chaos. Build structure. And teach you how to think, act and move like the future version of yourself you want to become.

      <h2 class="section-title">Food Diary Analysis</h2>
      <p class="section-description">
        You’ll be asked to keep a full 7-day food diary — recording <strong>everything</strong> you consume: times, amounts, reasons and how you felt after each meal or snack. This must be 100% honest — there’s no judgement. In fact, it’s often the <em>act</em> of writing down your intake that already starts to shift behaviour.
      </p>
      <p class="section-description">
        This diary gives me insight into your routines, triggers and relationship with food — so we can build strategies that prevent pitfalls before they happen. In the premium package, you can also upload <strong>images of your meals</strong>, and I’ll personally break down your macro intake and send you the full analysis.

        <h3 class="faq-question">Is this for me if I’ve failed before?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Especially if you’ve failed before. This isn’t a surface-level coaching plan — this is about removing the underlying reasons why things haven’t worked in the past.
